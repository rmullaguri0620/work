<p style="text-indent:60px">
A blender is a great coffee grinder replacement if you are in a pinch as it uses a blade system that will chop the beans up similar to coffee blade grinders. 
Some blenders also include a “grinder” setting that is ideal for coffee beans.

However, when using a blender, make sure only to grind in small spurts rather than continuously running because as the blades 


hey will start to cook the beans natural oils leading to a harsh and bitter tasting coffee. Because of the sporadic grinding technique, it is recommended to use the grinder only to produce a relatively coarse grind.

Oh, and make sure that after using, you properly clean the 'grinder' so that your blender doesn’t taste and smell like stale coffee.
