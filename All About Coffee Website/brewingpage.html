<h1> Making Coffee <h1>

<h2 id ="T"> Temperature </h2>

<p>
If you buy whole bean coffee, always grind your beans as close to the brew time as possible for maximum freshness.
 A burr or mill grinder is best because the coffee is ground to a consistent size. 
Depending on who you ask, it is either a super healthy beverage or incredibly harmful.

But despite what you may have heard, there are actually plenty of good things to be said about coffee.

For example, it is high in antioxidants and linked to a reduced risk of many diseases. </p>

 
<p>
A blade grinder is less preferable because some coffee will be ground more finely than the rest. If you normally grind your coffee at home with a blade grinder, 
try having it ground at the store with a burr grinder. You’ll be surprised at the difference!

<p>
The size of the grind is hugely important to the taste of your coffee. If your coffee tastes bitter,
 it may be over-extracted, or ground too fine.  On the other hand, if your coffee tastes flat, it may be under-extracted, meaning your grind is too coarse.</p>

<p>
The water you use is very important to the quality of your coffee. Use filtered or bottled water if your tap water is not good or has a strong odor or taste, such as chlorine. 

If you’re using tap water, let it run a few seconds before filling your coffee pot, and be sure to use cold water. Avoid distilled or softened water.

<h4 id ="W">Water</h4>
<p>
A general guideline is called the "Golden Ratio" - one to two tablespoons of ground coffee for every six ounces of water. This can be adjusted to suit individual taste preferences.  

Check the cup lines or indicators on your specific brewer to see how they actually measure. And remember that some water is lost to evaporation in certain brewing methods.
